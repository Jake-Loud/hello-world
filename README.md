# hello-world
Hi I am a person *wink*

My name is Jake, I love problem solving and creation.
I've been facinated be the creation of things and how things work since I was little.
I got into computer science, (more toward developing) because I wanted a creative field that covered multiple facets of life.
I want to enjoy my work, I don't want to work to buy things or pay for things.
Sofware is a world where anyone can find a place (or multiple places) to belong and connect to.
I am 21 and in progress for an associates in Computer Science.
My biggest love in software is game development and design.
I would love to work in that field and have my own game development studio.
The 2 biggest languages I want to focus on are Python and C#.
Python I hear is an easy language to start with to grasp programming.
C# is used in a lot of gaming applications and engines such as Unity.
